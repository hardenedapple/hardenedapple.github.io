      <h1>Puzzle challenge</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
    I had a strange idea recently, and when it worked I made it into a little
    challenge. That challenge can be found
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/hardenedapple/7ab47b898b923d549404a9c2e7aec129">here</a>
    and consists of a hex dump of a binary file that can be run on x86 Linux
    but contains <i>"something more"</i> that provides a "password".
    </p>
    <p>
    For those that want to try their hand at the challenge I'll simply say
    that you'll know when you get the password. The chances of getting an
    english word from the required sequence of actions on any random
    executable are so small that it should give you confidence in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
    For those that want a clue (be aware ... it's a pretty big clue),
    click <a href="clue.html">here</a>, and for those that have given up, a
    walkthrough of the reasoning I envisaged someone making is
    <a href="walkthrough.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I apologise if the leap to make was too large -- it's very difficult to
    judge what obfuscation techniques to apply and what clues to leave.
    Some of my indicision is hinted at in the comments of
    <a href="making_of.html">the assembly files</a> that create the test, and
    (obviously) also spoils the challenge.
