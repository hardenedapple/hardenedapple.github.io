    <p>
      A while ago I was working through the
      <a href="https://hackthissite.org">hackthissite.org</a> challenges.
      One of the challenge categories is "Steganography", which revolves around
      hiding secrets in images.
      As I would attempt these challenges, I kept looking for the solution in
      places that ended up to be irrelevant.  
      After thinking about it for a little time I ended up thinking you certainly
      could hide a secret of some sort where I was looking, and decided to write
      my own challenge along the same lines.

      NOTE: I have not finished all of those challenges so it is possible that
      a challenge along the lines of what I did here exists.

    <p>
      The image I produced is below.  The challenge is simply to find the
      password in it.  There is no validation form to check your answer but the
      answer can be found at the bottom of the
      <a href="walkthrough.html">walkthrough</a> describing how I envisaged the
      challenge being solved.
      I expect the jump to make is too large without a hint, so there is a clue
      provided <a href="clue.html">here</a>.

      In keeping with the other puzzles I've put on this site I'm including the
      code I used to produce the puzzle.  This isn't particularly cleaned, and
      includes some notes to myself on figuring out how to implement what I
      wanted.

      Those are the files <a href="analysis.py">analysis.py</a>,
      <a href="decoder.py">decoder.py</a>,
      <a href="encoder.py">encoder.py</a>,
      <a href="investigation.vsh">investigation.vsh</a>, and
      <a href="extracting-letters.vsh">extracting-letters.vsh</a>.
      While I used the image
      <a href="creating-letters.png">creating-letters.png</a> (generated from
      gimp by just typing in some text) to form some letters to use.
