      <h1>Puzzle 2 - Making Of</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      I'm not going to give a tutorial on dynamic linking in Linux here
      (largely because I don't understand most of it), but for our purposes
      there are only a few bits of information to know.
      <ul>
        <li>Library functions are called via indirection.</li>
        <li>The main code calles a linkage stub.</li>
        <li>Library function addresses are stored in a table.</li>
        <li>This table is lazily filled in at run-time</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When looking at a program using a disassembler, all you see is that it
      calls the linkage stub.
      This linkage stub jumps directly to the position stored in the function
      table.
      If this entry of the function table hasn't been set up yet, the stub
      calls the dynamic loader asking it to fill in the correct address and
      call the function while it's at it.
      From then on the linkage stub will be able to go straight to the library
      function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Checking whether the function table has been set up yet, and defaulting
      to jumping to the function if it has is done in a rather clever way.
      For example let's look at the linkage stub table in our puzzle binary.
      <pre>
        <code>
vshcmd: &gt; objdump -j .plt -d test_password

test_password:     file format elf64-x86-64


Disassembly of section .plt:

0000000000400420 &lt;.plt&gt;:
  400420:	ff 35 e2 0b 20 00    	pushq  0x200be2(%rip)        # 601008 &lt;_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+0x8&gt;
  400426:	ff 25 e4 0b 20 00    	jmpq   *0x200be4(%rip)        # 601010 &lt;_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+0x10&gt;
  40042c:	0f 1f 40 00          	nopl   0x0(%rax)

0000000000400430 &lt;puts@plt&gt;:
  400430:	ff 25 e2 0b 20 00    	jmpq   *0x200be2(%rip)        # 601018 &lt;puts@GLIBC_2.2.5&gt;
  400436:	68 00 00 00 00       	pushq  $0x0
  40043b:	e9 e0 ff ff ff       	jmpq   400420 &lt;.plt&gt;

0000000000400440 &lt;strcmp@plt&gt;:
  400440:	ff 25 da 0b 20 00    	jmpq   *0x200bda(%rip)        # 601020 &lt;strcmp@GLIBC_2.2.5&gt;
  400446:	68 01 00 00 00       	pushq  $0x1
  40044b:	e9 d0 ff ff ff       	jmpq   400420 &lt;.plt&gt;
fake_plt [16:38:09] $ </code>
      </pre>
      Looking at the <code>strcmp@plt</code> entry, we see that it
      unconditionally jumps to the address stored in <code>0x601020</code>.
      Calling into the dynamic loader in order to handle setting up the offset
      table is handled by the three instructions at the <code>.plt</code>, and
      that is gotten to by the last instruction in each <code>@plt</code> stub.
      That last instruction is reached because the function table in the binary
      itself starts with the location in memory of the <code>pushq</code>
      instruction in each corresponding stub.
    </p>
    <p>
       When the stub is first called, it jumps straight to the
       <code>pushq</code> instruction that follows it, so that the
       initialisation is performed.
       From then on the offset stored in the function table is the correct
       location of the library function, so the <code>jmpq</code> instruction
       goes there, and the initialisation code isn't ran.
    </p>
    <h2>Playing Tricks</h2>
    <p>Following the discussion above, we can see that if we were to change
    addresses in the function table as it is stored in the <em>file</em>, then
    instead of falling through to the initialisation code, the linkage stub
    will correctly jump to the position we define.
    There is no change in the calling code, so as far as it knows it's calling
    the library function, and the tricks we're playing are hidden behind the
    linkage indirection.
    </p>
    <p>
    This means that from plain disassembly of instructions no-one can tell the
    difference between our trick binary and a normal one.
    Moreover many people used to stepping through instructions in an executable
    will not notice anything strange (apart from the outcome) the first time
    they debug it, as people get accustomed to skipping over known library
    functions.
    </p>
    <p>The second or third time through a debugger someone might notice that
    <code>strcmp()</code> isn't doing what it should, and stepi into the
    other function.</p>
    <p>I used this by overwriting the <code>strcmp@plt</code> entry in the
    function table with the position of a function in the main binary that has
    the same calling signature but different functionality.
    I gave this function a name that sounds internal <code>__exit_elf64</code>
    and made it check that string 1 was what you get from decrementing every
    character in string 2.
    Hence when <code>check_password()</code> called
    <code>strcmp("etmrhdr ", password)</code> it was actually checking that
    <code>password</code> was equal to <code>"funsies!"</code>.</p>
    <p>The specifics of how to do that can be seen in
