      <h1>Thoughts on Compiler Optimisations</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      This is a story about how I changed my mind on something, or I guess how
      I realised something.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my day job I work on compilers.
      I mainly have an interest around adding instrumentation for enhanced
      security or sanitisation, and architecture enablement.
      During some chats with people in my office they mentioned how they found
      working on performance optimisations much more interesting.  I understood
      that position, since the algorithms can be very interesting to get
      into.  However I always found more of a sense of achievement in adding
      some instrumentation feature.
    </p>

    <p>
      I always found such instrumentation more worthwhile since I could see a
      fundamental difference to the user of the compiler.  Sure it wasn't used
      every compilation, but I was providing a new ability (e.g. the ability to
      catch certain problems at run time) while working on performance just
      provided a very small benefit that many people wouldn't even notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's not to say that improving performance in general seemed pointless, I had
      taken to heart the idea that a large enough improvement in performance could
      change how people use something.  I believed that such huge improvements were
      certainly worth achieving (this is quite obvious in my day-to-day work,
      since our testsuite takes so long that I tend to run it overnight).
      However given Proebstingâ€™s law (a somewhat tongue-in-cheek law that says compiler
      optimisations provide a doubling of speed every 18 <em>years</em>) pales
      in comparison to the progress of Moores law, how could such a small
      improvement do anything for the users?
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently I was idly musing on what change a huge improvement in compiler
      performance could even bring.  Especially since you can't actually do any
      more work on the processor, so there's a hard limit on any performance
      improvement of your program.
      When thinking about what sort of change the compiler could cause I
      started thinking in terms of what a difference in compiler performance
      would look like compared to a difference in processor speed.
      I figured the main difference would be that you could write programs in
      more expressive ways, avoiding ugly tricks that people sometimes do in
      the name of performance.
    </p>

    <aside>
      I think this looks very similar to benefits you could get from a new
      programming language, but within the same language so keeping your
      ecosystem.
    </aside>

    <p>
      But that's already happening!  In fact I hit this recently when a
      collegue caught some ugly bit of my code and pointed out that Scalar
      Replacement of Aggregates (SRA) would take care of the performance
      improvement I was trying to manually handle. He didn't even have to
      convince me of the fact that it was silly to be worrying about
      performance here, he could promise me the tiny extra performance I was
      concerned about with the cleaner source code.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what was the problem with my original thought process?  Essentially, the
      performance improvement required to change behaviour <em>does not have to
      be big</em>.  In some cases it merely has to be enough to change someone's
      mind rather than be big enough to change what's possible.
      In this particular case it had to be enough to remove the little voice in my
      head complaining about the tiny amount of pointless work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I guess it's somewhat similar to the joke about not needing to outswim a
      shark, just having to outswim whoever you're with -- in this case it's
      not the performance improvement from that SRA optimisation that matters,
      it's that the SRA optimisation generated code is no slower on pretty
      source compared to ugly source.
    </p>

    <p>
      And that's how I came to recognise more of the worth of compiler
      optimisations.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summary: though compiler optimisations don't seem very powerful in
      percentage terms, they can still cause a real change in programmers
      behaviour -- letting them write in a more expressive manner rather than
      worrying so much about some classes of optimisations.
