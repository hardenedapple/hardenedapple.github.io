      <h1>About this Website</h1>
     <aside>In case you were wondering: why so plain?</aside>
    </header>
    <p>I'm trying to learn about web technologies at the same time as making
    some posts.
    As such I'm following my usual practice of getting comfortable with the
    most basic abstraction before using the more complicated ones.</p>
    <p>For web I have the following plan:
    <ol>
      <li>Use HTML and CSS only.</li>
      <li>Allow a basic compilation step.</li>
      <li>Allow more complicated compilation step.</li>
      <li>Include Javascript (minimal use of libraries).</li>
    </ol>
    These steps can also be written as below
    <ol>
      <li>No compilation, no scripting.</li>
      <li>Basic compilation (e.g. C pre-processor), no scripting.</li>
      <li>Programmatic compilation, no scripting.</li>
      <li>Programmatic compilation and browser scripting.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>I'm noting those things I want on the webpage, but as yet don't have.
    At each step I'll try to introduce these features, and/or go back to see if
    features already implemented could be implemented better using the new
    technology.</p>
    <h2>Missing Features</h2>
    <h4 id="htmlDRY">Deduplicating HTML</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <h5>HTML & CSS</h5>
      <p>As far as I can tell, there is no way to include snippets of HTML
      instead of manually adding the same <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> in each HTML
      file of the page.</p>
      <h5>With Compilation</h5>
      <p>This would be trivial with the C Pre-Processor, and I assume with any
      static website generator too.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="postCategorisation">Categorising Posts</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <h5>HTML & CSS</h5>
      <p>With such a small number of posts, categorisation by hierarchical file
      system is more than sufficient.
      This may change when I write more posts.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="indexing">Automatic Indexing</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>I currently have to manually index my posts on the main page,
      this is error-prone and tedious (or at least would be if I had a lot of
      posts).
      I would like a way to automatically index them, either by pointing to an
      index node from the main page or by automatically including an index in the
      main page.</p>
      <h5>HTML & CSS</h5>
      <p>While this is possible by specifying directory indexing in the HTTP
      server settings, <code>github.io</code> doesn't allow configuration of the
      server (which is fair enough).</p>
      <h5>With Compilation</h5>
      <p>This is the obvious way to combine all posts in some category into a
      HTML list.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="codeSnippets">Insertion of Code Snippets</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <h5>HTML & CSS</h5>
      <p>While I'm sacrificing the ability to view a file in the browser so I
      only have my program code defined in one place
      (<a href="#browserViewCode">see here</a>), including code snippets in
      the web page is important enough to make the opposite tradeoff.</p>
      <p>I do need a per-snippet compilation step where I HTML escape the code
      from one file before inserting it into the HTML file.</p>
      <h5>With Compilation</h5>
      <p>In a perfect world I would be able to label positions in my source file,
      and have that automatically inserted into my page.
      This would combine the manual per-snippet compilation step into the already
      present compilation step for generating the site.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="syntaxHighlighting">Syntax Highlighting of Code Snippets</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>I have a reasonable amount of code in my posts, it's nice to highlight
      them according to syntax.</p>
      <h5>HTML & CSS</h5>
      <p>As there is already a per-snippet compilation step, it takes little
      effort to make it include syntax highlighting.
      This can be done with a few programs online, or with the
      <code>:TOhtml</code> vim command.
      As I'm already copying the text from a vim buffer, the <code>:TOhtml</code>
      command is the obvious way to work.</p>
      <h5>With Compilation</h5>
      <p>With a compilation step, the syntax highlighting could be applied in the
      same manner, but rather than applying the vim specific syntax items it
      would make more sense to use some plugin.</p>
      <h5>With Javascript</h5>
      <p>I have seen quite a few javascript libraries to syntax highlight code,
      but I'm not sure what their benefits are over using the compilation step to
      mark the syntax items with a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="browserViewCode">View Code in Browser</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <h5>HTML & CSS</h5>
      <p>This is perfectly viable by customising the server to specify the
      mime-type of my source code files as <code>text/plain</code>, but again I
      don't have control over the server configuration.</p>
      <p>Even with customisation of the server, there would be no syntax
      highlighting, so this wouldn't be perfect.</p>
      <p>I could manually convert the source files to HTML files, or plain text,
      but I then have to make sure to update the derived file every time the
      canonical file changes.</p>
      <h5>With Compilation</h5>
      <p>If there is already a compilation step, then I can put the work of
      converting the canonical file to a derived file in there, and everything
      will be fine.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="navigationSidebar">Navigation Sidebar</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>I would like a sidebar for ease of navigation around the site.
      At the moment the links between pages are reasonably sparse.
      </p>
      <p>I haven't yet looked into how to do this.</p>
